# State of sparsity

This repo is a [fork](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/state_of_sparsity) of a google research repo that gives access to pretrained checkpoints of pruned Transformer Networks.

In conjunction with https://github.com/ybisk/charNMT-noise, I'm going to evaluate the robustness to synthetic and natural noise of the pruned models
